**Planned-Eat Web** is a high-performance single-page application (SPA) built to showcase the innovative features of the Planned-Eat ecosystem. 

Designed with **React Native Web**, it delivers a seamless, native-like experience across all devices—from desktop browsers to mobile screens. The landing page features a cutting-edge **Glassmorphism design**, dynamic **scroll animations** powered by Reanimated, and a vibrant **Green-themed** aesthetic that reflects the app's focus on health and vitality.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Glassmorphism & Glow Effects**: Modern UI trends including background blurs, deep charcoal themes, and vibrant accent glows (Priot.io inspired).
- **Interactive Cards**: Feature and Team cards with smooth, physics-based hover animations.
- **Responsive Layout**: A "Write Once, Run Everywhere" codebase that adapts perfectly to any screen size.
